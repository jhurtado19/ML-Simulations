%% Long Term Dynamics of SNIC Simulation

phase_portrait(2,0,10,200,false);
% In this plot we have visualized the long term dynamics of the
% Morris-Lecar model using EM, with the same shading scheme as above. Our
% general observation here is the presence of a limit cycle of an infinite
% period initially, and then at a certain point (the bifurcation point) the
% limit cycle disapears and becomes what looks to be a stable focus attractor. The dissapearance of a limit cycle
% is characteristic of the saddle node invariant cycle bifurcation, Class I
% neurons.
